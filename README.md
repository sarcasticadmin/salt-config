# Robs Salt States
## Overview
My OS of choice is `FreeBSD` so all of these states will be tailored toward that.

## Pillar
Copy `pillar_example` to `pillar` and modify the specifics the pillars for the environment.
> The `pillar` directory is specifically ignored because it contains semi-sensitive data.
