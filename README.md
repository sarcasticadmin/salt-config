# Robs Salt States

## Deprecation Notice

These configs have been superseded, see my newer [systems repo](https://github.com/sarcasticadmin/systems)

## Overview

My OS of choice is `FreeBSD` so all of these states will be tailored toward that.

## Pillar

Copy `pillar_example` to `pillar` and modify the specifics the pillars for the environment.
> The `pillar` directory is specifically ignored because it contains semi-sensitive data.
